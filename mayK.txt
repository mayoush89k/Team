Strengths
Like any graph database, Neo4j has the below advantages:

Performance
Graph databases as well as Neo4j provides much better performance when it comes to querying deeply connected data that has many relationships expressed with complex joins.
Flexibility
The graph data model is more natural. It has no impedance mismatch and is whiteboard friendly.
Powerful Query Model
The graph query model is so intuitive and makes it very suitable for applications with object oriented, semi-structured and network like data.
Easy to Learn Query Language
Neo4j provides a powerful traversal framework using an easy to learn query language called Cypher.
ACID Compliant
Neo4j is compliant with the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and provides full transaction support


Weaknesses
Neo4j has the below main weaknesses:

Scalability
Neo4j supports HA master-slave clusters that can linearly scale reads where slaves can share the read load.
Storage
Neo4j has some upper bound limit for the graph size and can support single graphs having tens of billions of nodes, relationships and properties.
Summary
Neo4j is suitable for applications where you have very large connected data and you want to run complex join-intensive queries and still get high performance.
