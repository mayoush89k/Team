<h2>What is a Neo4j graph database?</h2>
A Neo4j graph database stores nodes and relationships instead of tables or documents. Data is stored just like you might sketch ideas on a whiteboard. Your data is stored without restricting it to a pre-defined model, allowing a very flexible way of thinking about and using it.

<h3>What is Neo4j?</h3>
Neo4j is offered as a managed cloud service via AuraDB. But you can also run Neo4j yourself with either Community Edition or Enterprise Edition. The Enterprise Edition includes all the features of Community Edition, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover abilities. Neo4j is written in Java and Scala, and the source code is available on GitHub.

<h3>What makes Neo4j the easiest graph to work with?</h3>
Cypher®, a declarative query language similar to SQL

<h2>How to use the Neo4J:</h2>
I. Setup neo4j:

    1.Download neo4j Desktop, and install it.
    
    2. After installation, click “New Graph” under My Project section, then “create a Local Graph”. Write down the name of the graph, and the password.
    
    3. Run the database, clicking the “play” sign.

 II. Create your neo4j graph database :
 Let’s say your data is about people and organisations. People are one kind of ‘node’ and Organisations are another kind. They can be connected through a specific relationship. Like someone has worked for a company, someone is the chairman of the company, or a company is the parent of another company.

     1. Writing CYPHER queries in the neo4j browser.
     CYPHER is a flexible language, you can create nodes, relationships and even both together at the same time.

     2. Pasting CYPHER queries from Excel with an Excel formula.
